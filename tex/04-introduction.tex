% Introduction to the thesis

\section{History and Motivation}

This is where you set the context for your thesis, by reviewing historic development in the field, and argue why the problem you want to solve is relevant.
Typically a short review of references. Example: The book in ref. \cite{altland2010condensed} is great, and the work of \cite{Thouless1982,Tomonaga1950} is very nice.
